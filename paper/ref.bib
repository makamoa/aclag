  abstract = {Syngas, an extremely important chemical feedstock composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, can be generated through methane (CH4) dry reforming with CO2. However, traditional thermocatalytic processes require high temperatures and suffer from coke-induced instability. Here, we report a plasmonic photocatalyst consisting of a Cu nanoparticle `antenna' with single-Ru atomic `reactor' sites on the nanoparticle surface, ideal for low-temperature, light-driven methane dry reforming. This catalyst provides high light energy efficiency when illuminated at room temperature. In contrast to thermocatalysis, long-term stability (50{\thinspace}h) and high selectivity (>99{\%}) were achieved in photocatalysis. We propose that light-excited hot carriers, together with single-atom active sites, cause the observed performance. Quantum mechanical modelling suggests that single-atom doping of Ru on the Cu(111) surface, coupled with excited-state activation, results in a substantial reduction in the barrier for CH4 activation. This photocatalyst design could be relevant for future energy-efficient industrial processes.},

Zhou et al. studied the decomposition of ammonia to hydrogen on a copper alloy nanostructure that absorbed light and generated electrons that activated nitrogen atoms on ruthenium surface atoms (see the Perspective by Cort{\'e}s). By measuring reaction rates at different wavelengths, light intensities, and catalyst surface temperatures, the light-induced reduction of the apparent activation barrier was quantified.Science, this issue p. 69; see also p. 28Photocatalysis based on optically active, {\textquotedblleft}plasmonic{\textquotedblright} metal nanoparticles has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate light-driven chemical conversions under far milder conditions than thermal catalysis. However, an understanding of the relation between thermal and electronic excitations has been lacking. We report the substantial light-induced reduction of the thermal activation barrier for ammonia decomposition on a plasmonic photocatalyst. We introduce the concept of a light-dependent activation barrier to account for the effect of light illumination on electronic and thermal excitations in a single unified picture. This framework provides insight into the specific role of hot carriers in plasmon-mediated photochemistry, which is critically important for designing energy-efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.},

  abstract = {A very basic pathway from CO2 to ethylene
Ethylene is an important commodity chemical for plastics. It is considered a tractable target for synthesizing renewably from carbon dioxide (CO2). The challenge is that the performance of the copper electrocatalysts used for this conversion under the required basic reaction conditions suffers from the competing reaction of CO2 with the base to form bicarbonate. Dinh et al. designed an electrode that tolerates the base by optimizing CO2 diffusion to the catalytic sites (see the Perspective by Ager and Lapkin). This catalyst design delivers 70\% efficiency for 150 hours.
Science, this issue p. 783; see also p. 707
Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction could provide a useful source of ethylene, but low conversion efficiency, low production rates, and low catalyst stability limit current systems. Here we report that a copper electrocatalyst at an abrupt reaction interface in an alkaline electrolyte reduces CO2 to ethylene with 70\% faradaic efficiency at a potential of -0.55 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Hydroxide ions on or near the copper surface lower the CO2 reduction and carbon monoxide (CO)\textendash{}CO coupling activation energy barriers; as a result, onset of ethylene evolution at -0.165 volts versus an RHE in 10 molar potassium hydroxide occurs almost simultaneously with CO production. Operational stability was enhanced via the introduction of a polymer-based gas diffusion layer that sandwiches the reaction interface between separate hydrophobic and conductive supports, providing constant ethylene selectivity for an initial 150 operating hours.
Electrode design facilitates reductive coupling of CO2 to ethylene under otherwise inhibitory strongly basic conditions.

  abstract = {The engineering of broadband absorbers to harvest white light in thin-film semiconductors is a major challenge in developing renewable materials for energy harvesting. Many solution-processed materials with high manufacturability and low cost, such as semiconductor quantum dots, require the use of film structures with thicknesses on the order of 1 {$\mu$}m to absorb incoming photons completely. The electron transport lengths in these media, however, are 1 order of magnitude smaller than this length, hampering further progress with this platform. Herein, we show that, by engineering suitably disordered nanoplasmonic structures, we have created a new class of dispersionless epsilon-near-zero composite materials that efficiently harness white light. Our nanostructures localize light in the dielectric region outside the epsilon-near-zero material with characteristic lengths of 10\textendash{}100 nm, resulting in an efficient system for harvesting broadband light when a thin absorptive film is deposited on top of the structure. By using a combination of theory and experiments, we demonstrate that ultrathin layers down to 50 nm of colloidal quantum dots deposited atop the epsilon-near-zero material show an increase in broadband absorption ranging from 200\% to 500\% compared to a planar structure of the same colloidal quantum-dot-absorber average thickness. When the epsilon-near-zero nanostructures were used in an energy-harvesting module, we observed a spectrally averaged 170\% broadband increase in the external quantum efficiency of the device, measured at wavelengths between 400 and 1200 nm. Atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence excitation measurements demonstrate that the properties of these epsilon-near-zero structures apply to general metals and could be used to enhance the near-field absorption of semiconductor structures more widely. We have developed an inexpensive electrochemical deposition process that enables scaled-up production of this nanomaterial for large-scale energy-harvesting applications.},

As an effective route toward near-field light enhancement, metal nanostructures with subwavelength dimensions can couple incident photons with conduction electrons, giving rise to localized surface plasmon resonances. However, efficiency enhancements through plasmonic routes are limited to the short wavelength range corresponding to metal extinction wavelength. Thus, the exploration of novel plasmonic nanostructures with predesigned sizes and shapes is needed to advance this field. Herein, for the first time, a bioinspired nanostructure of Au nanorod\textendash{}nanoparticle dimers with structural darkness is exploited to enhance the light harvesting and performance of perovskite solar cells. Differing from conventional metallic nanoparticles, biometric nanoparticles introduce geometric singularity to the system, providing a broadband response for energy harvesting. By embedding the core\textendash{}shell gold dimers in the perovskite solar cells, a notable enhancement of broadband light absorption is observed, and sequentially, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells increases by 16\%.},

  abstract = {The direct conversion of solar energy into fuels or feedstock is an attractive approach to address increasing demand of renewable energy sources. Photocatalytic systems relying on the direct photoexcitation of metals have been explored to this end, a strategy that exploits the decay of plasmonic resonances into hot carriers. An efficient hot carrier generation and collection requires, ideally, their generation to be enclosed within few tens of nanometers at the metal interface, but it is challenging to achieve this across the broadband solar spectrum. Here the authors demonstrate a new photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution based on metal epsilon-near-zero metamaterials. The authors have designed these to achieve broadband strong light confinement at the metal interface across the entire solar spectrum. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the authors prove that hot carriers are generated in a broadband fashion within 10 nm in this system. The resulting photocatalyst achieves a hydrogen production rate of 9.5 \textmu{}mol h-1 cm-2 that exceeds, by a factor of 3.2, that of the best previously reported plasmonic-based photocatalysts for the dissociation of H2 with 50 h stable operation.},

  abstract = {The design of optical resonant systems for controlling light at the nanoscale is an exciting field of research in nanophotonics. While describing the dynamics of systems with few resonances is a relatively well understood problem, controlling the behavior of systems with many overlapping states is considerably more difficult. In this work we formulate a form of time dependent coupled mode theory based on complete and orthogonal modes, which project Maxwell's dynamics into a set of spatio-temporal equations that retain both the simplicity and the exactness of traditional coupled mode theory studied for optical waveguides. We developed a fast and effective computational method that extracts all the characteristics of a multi-mode resonant system, including the full density of states, the modes quality factors, the mode resonances and linewidths from a single first principle simulation. This approach can be used to study both analytically and numerically the complex dynamics of systems with many overlapping resonances in ensembles of resonators of any geometrical shape defined in materials with arbitrary responses.},

  abstract = {Metal oxide protection layers for photoanodes may enable the development of large-scale solar fuel and solar chemical synthesis, but the poor photovoltages often reported so far will severely limit their performance. Here we report a novel observation of photovoltage loss associated with a charge extraction barrier imposed by the protection layer, and, by eliminating it, achieve photovoltages as high as 630{\thinspace}mV, the maximum reported so far for water-splitting silicon photoanodes. The loss mechanism is systematically probed in metal--insulator--semiconductor Schottky junction cells compared to buried junction p+n cells, revealing the need to maintain a characteristic hole density at the semiconductor/insulator interface. A leaky-capacitor model related to the dielectric properties of the protective oxide explains this loss, achieving excellent agreement with the data. From these findings, we formulate design principles for simultaneous optimization of built-in field, interface quality, and hole extraction to maximize the photovoltage of oxide-protected water-splitting anodes.},

In this paper, we propose a neural network that can complete an inverse design process to solve the problem. Compared with the traditional method, our method is much faster while competent of generating better devices with the desired spectrum. One of the most significant advantages is that it can handle a real spectrum as well as an artificial one.

Our deep learning network is highly accurate, achieving an average mean square error of only 1.16 \&\#x000D7; 10\&\#x02212;3 and is over five orders of magnitude faster than conventional electromagnetic simulation software. We further develop a novel method to solve the inverse modeling problem, termed fast forward dictionary search (FFDS), which offers tremendous controls to the designer and only requires an accurate forward neural network model.

The model can help to discover the intricate, nonintuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the time-consuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently but also enables one to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements.

  abstract = {The advent of metasurfaces in recent years has ushered in a revolutionary means to manipulate the behavior of light on the nanoscale. The design of such structures, to date, has relied on the expertise of an optical scientist to guide a progression of electromagnetic simulations that iteratively solve Maxwell's equations until a locally optimized solution can be attained. In this work, we identify a solution to circumvent this conventional design procedure by means of a deep learning architecture. When fed an input set of customer-defined optical spectra, the constructed generative network generates candidate patterns that match the on-demand spectra with high fidelity. This approach reveals an opportunity to expedite the discovery and design of metasurfaces for tailored optical responses in a systematic, inverse-design manner. C lose of the last century, discoveries in light-matter interactions on the nanoscale unlocked optical phenomena that would help to confine light to subwavelength scales, opening a gateway to a new era of optical design. The metasurfaces, a member of this family of new nanophotonic devices, is capable of generating periodic dipoles in order to manipulate the behavior of light in a nonclassically predicted manner. As such, a well-designed metasurface can tailor the transmittance and phase delay of electromagnetic waves over any wavelength spectrum. 1-5 The realization of these materials has led to a vast number of applications in perfect absorption, 6 super resolution imaging, 7,8 beam steering, 9,10 and nonlinear optical generation. 11,12 As these nanostructured materials require labor intensive fabrication, an accurate prediction of the optical spectrum and structure of the envisioned metasurfaces must be preemptively articulated. However, the complicated physical mechanisms that describe these light-matter interactions at the nanoscale cannot be resolved by generalized theory and as such the prediction of a material's optical properties and approximate structure relies on advanced iterative calculations achieved by finite-element modeling (FEM) or finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. Moreover, this conventional metasurface design process is innately flawed by human guided error. Not only is the initial design realized based on physical insights and intuitive reasoning, but the finalized geometric and material parameters are ultimately achieved by a means of trial-and-error. The design of such optical systems demands a working knowledge base of optics in order to moderate iterative simulations that scan multidimensional parameter spaces. Thanks to rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI), some scientific problems that classically required human perception or intricate mechanisms have recently been solved by AI. 13-17 Such methods have translated into the field of optics, by employing optimization methods 18-23 and evolutionary algorithms 24 to expedite the design of photonic devices. To accelerate the design process without extensive computation (numerical or analytical) of Maxwell's equations, data driven methods, especially deep neural networks, have been gradually incorporated into the design of microwave and nanophotonics devices. 25-28 With growing interest of new phenomena and applications using metasurfaces, there is an ever-pressing need to develop efficient methods that expedite the discovery and design of novel metasurface structures with custom-defined function-ality. As illustrated in Figure 1a, this work aims to leverage deep neural networks to approximate the spectra of a metasurface and, more importantly, to generate metasurface patterns that yield customer-defined spectra at the input. The latter is the long-sought-after goal of inverse optical design in which a working structure is to be generated directly based on the desired optical responses of the designer. In doing so, the need for extensive parameter scans or trial-and-error procedures is bypassed. However, due to the enormous degrees of freedom in typical metasurface patterns, conventional neural network schema, like backpropagation in trained simulator networks, 28 are impotent in the inverse design of metasurfaces. In addition, the trained simulator defines the problem as a deterministic system, such that a single simulator will inevitably lead to a fixed outcome for a given input condition. Meanwhile, multiple solutions may exist for the same target spectrum fed to the simulator at the input, thereby imposing an unnecessary constraint on the diversity of the optimized structures.},

A key feature of the network is that it initially generates a distribution of devices that broadly samples the design space and then shifts and refines this distribution toward favorable design space regions over the course of optimization. Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance.},

  abstract = {Background Deep learning (DL) based solutions have been proposed for interpretation of several imaging modalities including radiography, CT, and MR. For chest radiographs, DL algorithms have found success in the evaluation of abnormalities such as lung nodules, pulmonary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, and location of peripherally inserted central catheters. Chest radiography represents the most commonly performed radiological test for a multitude of non-emergent and emergent clinical indications. This study aims to assess accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithm for detection of abnormalities on routine frontal chest radiographs (CXR), and assessment of stability or change in findings over serial radiographs. Methods and findings We processed 874 de-identified frontal CXR from 724 adult patients ({$>$} 18 years) with DL (Qure AI). Scores and prediction statistics from DL were generated and recorded for the presence of pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, hilar prominence, and enlarged cardiac silhouette. To establish a standard of reference (SOR), two thoracic radiologists assessed all CXR for these abnormalities. Four other radiologists (test radiologists), unaware of SOR and DL findings, independently assessed the presence of radiographic abnormalities. A total 724 radiographs were assessed for detection of findings. A subset of 150 radiographs with follow up examinations was used to asses change over time. Data were analyzed with receiver operating characteristics analyses and post-hoc power analysis. Results About 42\% (305/ 724) CXR had no findings according to SOR; single and multiple abnormalities were seen in 23\% (168/724) and 35\% (251/724) of CXR. There was no statistical difference between DL and SOR for all abnormalities (p = 0.2\textendash{}0.8). The area under the curve (AUC) for DL and test radiologists ranged between 0.837\textendash{}0.929 and 0.693\textendash{}0.923, respectively. DL had lowest AUC (0.758) for assessing changes in pulmonary opacities over follow up CXR. Presence of chest wall implanted devices negatively affected the accuracy of DL algorithm for evaluation of pulmonary and hilar abnormalities. Conclusions DL algorithm can aid in interpretation of CXR findings and their stability over follow up CXR. However, in its present version, it is unlikely to replace radiologists due to its limited specificity for categorizing specific findings.},

  abstract = {Background:Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways, including enabling serial assessment of cardiac function by nonexperts in primary care and rural settings. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection.Methods:Using 14\,035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Results:Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96\% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15\% to 17\% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7\% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5\%, n=419, and 9.0\%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively.Conclusions:Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support serial patient tracking and scalable analysis of millions of echocardiograms archived within healthcare systems.},

	abstract = {Although mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy is a mainstay of molecular fingerprinting, its sensitivity is diminished somewhat when looking at small volumes of sample. Nanophotonics provides a platform to enhance the detection capability. Tittl et al. built a mid-IR nanophotonic sensor based on reflection from an all-dielectric metasurface array of specially designed scattering elements. The scattering elements could be tuned via geometry across a broad range of wavelengths in the mid-IR. The approach successfully detected and differentiated the absorption fingerprints of various molecules. The technique offers the prospect of on-chip molecular fingerprinting without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or moving mechanical parts.Science, this issue p. 1105Metasurfaces provide opportunities for wavefront control, flat optics, and subwavelength light focusing. We developed an imaging-based nanophotonic method for detecting mid-infrared molecular fingerprints and implemented it for the chemical identification and compositional analysis of surface-bound analytes. Our technique features a two-dimensional pixelated dielectric metasurface with a range of ultrasharp resonances, each tuned to a discrete frequency; this enables molecular absorption signatures to be read out at multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into a barcode-like spatial absorption map for imaging. The signatures of biological, polymer, and pesticide molecules can be detected with high sensitivity, covering applications such as biosensing and environmental monitoring. Our chemically specific technique can resolve absorption fingerprints without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or moving mechanical parts, thereby paving the way toward sensitive and versatile miniaturized mid-infrared spectroscopy devices.},

  abstract = {Metasurfaces based on resonant subwavelength photonic structures enable novel ways of wavefront control and light focusing, underpinning a new generation of flat-optics devices1. Recently emerged all-dielectric asymmetric metasurfaces, composed of arrays of metaunits with broken in-plane inversion symmetry2-7, exhibit high-quality resonances originating from the intriguing physics of bound states in the continuum. Here, we combine dielectric metasurfaces and hyperspectral imaging to develop an ultrasensitive label-free analytical platform for biosensing. Our technique can acquire spatially resolved spectra from millions of image pixels and use smart data-processing tools to extract high-throughput digital sensing information at the unprecedented level of less than three molecules per mm2. We further show spectral data retrieval from a single image without using spectrometers, enabled by our unique sensor design, paving the way for portable diagnostic applications. This combination of nanophotonics and imaging optics extends the capabilities of dielectric metasurfaces to analyse biological entities and atomic-layer-thick two-dimensional materials over large areas.},

Subwavelength light confinement and nanophotonic enhancement have extended the scope of this technique for monolayer studies. However, current approaches still require complex spectroscopic equipment or tunable light sources. Here, we introduce a novel metasurface-based method for detecting molecular absorption fingerprints over a broad spectrum, which combines the device-level simplicity of state-of-the-art angle-scanning refractometric sensors with the chemical specificity of infrared spectroscopy. Specifically, we develop germanium-based high-Q metasurfaces capable of delivering a multitude of spectrally selective and surface-sensitive resonances between 1100 and 1800 cm-1. We use this approach to detect distinct absorption signatures of different interacting analytes including proteins, aptamers, and polylysine. In combination with broadband incoherent illumination and detection, our method correlates the total reflectance signal at each incidence angle with the strength of the molecular absorption, enabling spectrometer-less operation in a compact angle-scanning configuration ideally suited for field-deployable applications.},

The central idea of this joint effort is to highlight key parameters and pitfalls that are often encountered in the literature. To that end, we provide here a series of recommendations on: a) the characterization of solid and colloidal SERS substrates by correlative electron and optical microscopy and spectroscopy, b) on the determination of the SERS enhancement factor (EF), including suitable Raman reporter/probe molecules, and finally on c) good analytical practice. We hope that both newcomers and specialists will benefit from these recommendations to increase the inter-laboratory comparability of experimental SERS results and further establish SERS as an analytical tool.},

Now, a synthetic approach for constructing a new class of frame nanostructures is presented. Fine control over the galvanic replacement reaction of Ag nanoprisms with Au precursors gave unprecedented Au particle-in-a-frame nanostructures with well-defined sub-2 nm interior nanogaps. The prepared nanostructures exhibited superior performance in applications, such as plasmonic sensing and surface-enhanced Raman scattering, over their solid nanostructure and nanoframe counterparts. This highlights the benefit of their interior hot spots, which can highly promote and maximize the electric field confinement within a single nanostructure.},

abstract = {Abstract Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a powerful analytical technique commonly used in the detection of traces of organic molecules. The mechanism of SERS is of a dual nature, with Raman scattering enhancements due to a combination of electromagnetic (EM) and chemical contributions. In conventional SERS, the EM component is largely responsible for the enhancement, with the chemical contribution playing a less significant role. An alternative technique, called photo-induced enhanced Raman spectroscopy (PIERS) has been recently developed, using a photo-activated semiconductor substrate to give additional chemical enhancement of Raman bands over traditional SERS. This enhancement is assigned to surface oxygen vacancies (Vo) formed upon pre-irradiation of the substrate. In this work, the exceptional chemical contribution in PIERS allows for the evaluation of atomic Vo dynamics in metal oxide surfaces. This technique is applied to study the formation and healing rates of surface-active Vo in archetypical metal-oxide semiconductors, namely, TiO2, WO3, and ZnO. Contrary to conventional analytical tools, PIERS provides intuitive and valuable information about surface stability of atomic defects at ambient pressure and under operando conditions, which has important implications in a wide range of applications including catalysis and energy storage materials.},

Light absorption at the metal surface plays a key role in inducing photochemical transformations of adsorbed molecules. Our current ability to control both the absorption cross-sections and the energy of absorbed light by metal plasmonic nanoparticles opens new pathways for the manipulation of photochemical reactions. Physical phenomena associated with the localized surface plasmon resonances, such as energetic surface states and intensified electric fields, force us to revisit our traditional understanding of photochemical reactions at metal surfaces. Long standing goals in the field – such as bond selectivity and increased efficiency of photocatalytic processes – might now be achievable, assisted by plasmonic nanoparticles. This Progress Report intends to examine some of the elementary concepts and mechanisms behind these processes in the context of the most recent advancements in the fields of plasmonic-assisted chemistry, charge transfer at the nanoscale, and surface photochemistry.},

abstract={Nanoscale localization of electromagnetic fields near metallic nanostructures underpins the fundamentals and applications of plasmonics. The unavoidable energy loss from plasmon decay, initially seen as a detriment, has now expanded the scope of plasmonic applications to exploit the generated hot carriers. However, quantitative understanding of the spatial localization of these hot carriers, akin to electromagnetic near-field maps, has been elusive. Here we spatially map hot-electron-driven reduction chemistry with 15 nm resolution as a function of time and electromagnetic field polarization for different plasmonic nanostructures. We combine experiments employing a six-electron photo-recycling process that modify the terminal group of a self-assembled monolayer on plasmonic silver nanoantennas, with theoretical predictions from first-principles calculations of non-equilibrium hot-carrier transport in these systems. The resulting localization of reactive regions, determined by hot-carrier transport from high-field regions, paves the way for improving efficiency in hot-carrier extraction science and nanoscale regio-selective surface chemistry.},

Quantum cryptography is unclonable, but requires quantum installations that are more expensive, slower, and less scalable than classical optical networks. Here we show a perfect secrecy cryptography in classical optical channels. The system exploits correlated chaotic wavepackets, which are mixed in inexpensive and CMOS compatible silicon chips. The chips can generate 0.1?Tbit of different keys for every mm of length of the input channel, and require the transmission of an amount of data that can be as small as 1/1000 of the message's length. We discuss the security of this protocol for an attacker with unlimited technological power, and who can access the system copying any of its part, including the chips. The second law of thermodynamics and the exponential sensitivity of chaos unconditionally protect this scheme against any possible attack.},

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy is a key technique to identify analytes that would otherwise be difficult to diagnose. In standard systems, hotspots are realised with nanostructures made by acute tips or narrow gaps. Owing to the low probability for molecules to reach such tiny active regions, high sensitivity is always accompanied by a large preparation time for analyte accumulation which hinders the time response. Inspired by transformation optics, we introduce an approach based on warped spaces to manipulate hotspots, resulting in broadband enhancements in both the magnitude and volume. Experiments for single molecule detection with a fast soaking time are realised in conjunction with broadband response and uniformity. Such engineering could provide a new design platform for a rich manifold of devices, which can benefit from broadband and huge field enhancements. © 2018, The Author(s).},

These photonics systems integrate complex dielectric and/or metallic units into large networks of heterogeneous elements, which are entirely controlled by acting on the interactions among the different units that compose the network. This Review presents a selection of recent results in this research field, discussing advantages, challenges and perspectives of this technology in addressing global challenges in several scientific areas, ranging from broadband light energy harvesting, to scalable clean water production, early-stage cancer detection, sensing, artificial intelligence, invisible structures, and to large-scale optical materials with programmable functionality and robust structural coloration. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract  = {The direct conversion of solar energy into fuels or feedstock is an attractive approach to address increasing demand of renewable energy sources. Photocatalytic systems relying on the direct photoexcitation of metals have been explored to this end, a strategy that exploits the decay of plasmonic resonances into hot carriers. An efficient hot carrier generation and collection requires, ideally, their generation to be enclosed within few tens of nanometers at the metal interface, but it is challenging to achieve this across the broadband solar spectrum. Here the authors demonstrate a new photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution based on metal epsilon-near-zero metamaterials. The authors have designed these to achieve broadband strong light confinement at the metal interface across the entire solar spectrum. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the authors prove that hot carriers are generated in a broadband fashion within 10 nm in this system. The resulting photocatalyst achieves a hydrogen production rate of 9.5 µmol h−1 cm−2 that exceeds, by a factor of 3.2, that of the best previously reported plasmonic-based photocatalysts for the dissociation of H2 with 50 h stable operation. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract  = {Nanophotonics is a rapidly developing field of research with many suggestions for a design of nanoantennas, sensors and miniature metadevices. Despite many proposals for passive nanophotonic devices, the efficient coupling of light to nanoscale optical structures remains a major challenge. In this article, we propose a nanoscale laser based on a tightly confined anapole mode. By harnessing the non-radiating nature of the anapole state, we show how to engineer nanolasers based on InGaAs nanodisks as on-chip sources with unique optical properties. Leveraging on the near-field character of anapole modes, we demonstrate a spontaneously polarized nanolaser able to couple light into waveguide channels with four orders of magnitude intensity than classical nanolasers, as well as the generation of ultrafast (of 100 fs) pulses via spontaneous mode locking of several anapoles. Anapole nanolasers offer an attractive platform for monolithically integrated, silicon photonics sources for advanced and efficient nanoscale circuitry.},

  abstract  = {Silicon-based (Si-based) junctions have been widely investigated in recent years as photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting photoelectrodes{,} including buried junctions and metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) Schottky junctions. However{,} Si-based MIS photoelectrodes suffer from low performance for the PEC oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the dilemma that a thin insulator cannot provide enough interfacial passivation while a thick insulator will block the transport of charge carriers. Another trade-off is the fact that the photovoltage extracted from the band offset between the metal and semiconductor will be counteracted by the parasitic light absorption of the metal layer{,} sacrificing the saturation photocurrent. This paper describes the design and realization of a bifacial passivation strategy for the metal/Si interface of an MIS photoelectrode{,} featuring a bi-layer stack consisting of amorphous silicon (a-Si) for passivating the silicon surface and a metal oxide (TiO2) for passivating the metal surface. Upon the bifacial passivation of both a-Si and TiO2{,} the minority carrier lifetime of the Si MIS photoanode was significantly improved from 18 to 2360 μs. Enabled by this extremely long minority carrier lifetime{,} it becomes possible to place the MIS junction on the back side of a Si substrate to construct an inverted-MIS (I-MIS) structure to eliminate the parasitic light absorption of traditional Si MIS photoelectrodes. The obtained photoelectrode exhibits an excellent onset potential of 0.85 V and 0.62 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the OER and HER{,} respectively. Eventually{,} unprecedented applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPE) of 3.91\% and 12.66\% were obtained by Si MIS and Si I-MIS{,} which are the highest among MIS-based photoanodes and photocathodes{,} with 30 h and 108 h stable operation. When pairing the Si I-MIS photocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a PEC membrane-free tandem cell{,} an unbiased solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.9\% is achieved.},

	abstract = {Solar-driven water splitting has potential as an energy storage mechanism to supplement the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity. A submersed integrated device has been proposed both to absorb the light and to catalyze the reaction, but stability has been a problem. Kenney et al. (p. 836; see the Perspective by Turner) found that a nickel coating, thin enough to let light through, could protect a silicon absorber in the alkaline environment of a lithium/potassium borate electrolyte. The nickel also functioned as the oxidation catalyst, and the lithium ions helped to establish a protective film structure in situ. Silicon{\textquoteright}s sensitivity to corrosion has hindered its use in photoanode applications. We found that deposition of a ~2-nanometer nickel film on n-type silicon (n-Si) with its native oxide affords a high-performance metal-insulator-semiconductor photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation in both aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH, pH = 14) and aqueous borate buffer (pH = 9.5) solutions. The Ni film acted as a surface protection layer against corrosion and as a nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution. In 1 M aqueous KOH, the Ni/n-Si photoanodes exhibited high PEC activity with a low onset potential (~1.07 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), high photocurrent density, and durability. The electrode showed no sign of decay after ~80 hours of continuous PEC water oxidation in a mixed lithium borate{\textendash}potassium borate electrolyte. The high photovoltage was attributed to a high built-in potential in a metal-insulator-semiconductor{\textendash}like device with an ultrathin, incomplete screening Ni/NiOx layer from the electrolyte.},

  abstract  = {The ability to regulate the tilt angle of Si nanostructures is important for their applications in photoelectric devices. Herein we demonstrate a facile method to precisely regulate the tilt angle of nanocones with metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) in a one-step process based on the systematic investigation of the formation mechanism of the tilt angle. With Au nanohole arrays as templates{,} the tilt angles of Si nanocone arrays can be tuned from 69.2° to 88.6° by varying the composition of the etchant. When the Si nanocone arrays are the same height (2.2 μm){,} the reflectivity decreases with the decreasing of the tilt angle. When the tilt angle is 83.0°{,} the average reflectivity is lowered to 1.37\% in the 250–1000 nm range. This method can be applied for fabrication over a large area (as large as 2 cm × 2 cm). This chemical method should be applicable to other Si nanostructures{,} which may promote the applications of MaCE in semiconductor manufacturing.},

  abstract  = {The plasmonic cavity arrays are ideal substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering analysis because they can provide hot spots with large volume for analyte molecules. The large area increases the probability to make more analyte molecules on hot spots and leads to a high reproducibility. Therefore, to develop a simple method for creating cavity arrays is important. Herein, we demonstrate how to fabricate a V and W shape cavity arrays by a simple method based on self-assembly. Briefly, the V and W shape cavity arrays are respectively fabricated by taking KOH etching on a nanohole and a nanoring array patterned silicon (Si) slides. The nanohole array is generated by taking a reactive ion etching on a Si slide assembled with monolayer of polystyrene (PS) spheres. The nanoring array is generated by taking a reactive ion etching on a Si slide covered with a monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane before self-assembling PS spheres. Both plasmonic V and W cavity arrays can provide large hot area, which increases the probability for analyte molecules to deposit on the hot spots. Taking 4-Mercaptopyridine as analyte probe, the enhancement factor can reach 2.99 × 105 and 9.97 × 105 for plasmonic V cavity and W cavity array, respectively. The relative standard deviations of the plasmonic V and W cavity arrays are 6.5\% and 10.2\% respectively according to the spectra collected on 20 random spots.},

	abstract = {Identification of benthic megafauna is commonly based on analysis of physical samples or imagery acquired by cameras mounted on underwater platforms. Physical collection of samples is difficult, particularly from the deep sea, and identification of taxonomic morphotypes from imagery depends on resolution and investigator experience. Here, we show how an Underwater Hyperspectral Imager (UHI) can be used as an alternative in situ taxonomic tool for benthic megafauna. A UHI provides a much higher spectral resolution than standard RGB imagery, allowing marine organisms to be identified based on specific optical fingerprints. A set of reference spectra from identified organisms is established and supervised classification performed to identify benthic megafauna semi-autonomously. The UHI data provide an increased detection rate for small megafauna difficult to resolve in standard RGB imagery. In addition, seafloor anomalies with distinct spectral signatures are also detectable. In the region investigated, sediment anomalies (spectral reflectance minimum at {\textasciitilde}675 nm) unclear in RGB imagery were indicative of chlorophyll a on the seafloor. Underwater hyperspectral imaging therefore has a great potential in seafloor habitat mapping and monitoring, with areas of application ranging from shallow coastal areas to the deep sea.},

abstract = {The first chapter of Neural Networks, Tricks of the Trade strongly advocates the stochastic back-propagation method to train neural networks. This is in fact an instance of a more general technique called stochastic gradient descent. This chapter provides background material, explains why SGD is a good learning algorithm when the training set is large, and provides useful recommendations. This chapter appears in the “reloaded” edition of the tricks book (springer). It completes the material presented in the initial chapter "Efficient Backprop".},
